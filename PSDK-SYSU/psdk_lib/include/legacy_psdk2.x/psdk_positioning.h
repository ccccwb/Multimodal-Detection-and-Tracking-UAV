 * @brief The interface is used to get the position of target points and other information (refer to
 * ::T_PsdkPositioningPositionInfo) based on the timestamp in aircraft time system when some events (positioning events) are
 * triggered. The function uses blocking mode.
 * @details Users can request positions for multiple events (event set) conveniently, such as sync exposure of
 * multiple cameras. User must register callback function used to get the newest PPS triggered timestamp (refer to
 * PsdkPositioning_RegGetNewestPpsTriggerTimeCallback()) before requesting position. When users have set structure
 * parameters of payload and interest points (the points whose position user hope to get, e.g. center point of the camera
 * image sensor), the target points are interest points, otherwise the target points are main gimbal interface center.
 * Users can use position information of gimbal interface center, position offset between gimbal interface center and
 * RTK main antenna, UAV attitude, gimbal structure parameters ,and gimbal attitude to calculate the position of interest
 * points in the payload.
 * @note Max execution time of this function is slightly larger than 600ms.
 * @note All requested timestamp have to be between the time point 2 seconds earlier than the newest synchronized
 * timestamp and the time point 1 seconds earlier than the newest synchronized timestamp.
 * @param eventCount: count of positioning event set specified by eventInfo parameter. Please ensure the count is less
 * than 5.
 * @param eventInfo: pointer to positioning event information array.
 * @param positionInfo: the position of target points. In Matrice 210 RTK V2 and Matrice 300 RTK aircraft system, it is
 * the position of the main gimbal interface always.
 * @return Execution result.

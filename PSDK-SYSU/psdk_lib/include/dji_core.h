 * @brief Initialize the Payload SDK core in blocking mode.
 * @note The call location of this interface requires special attention, The call needs to be completed after the
 * registration of console/OSAL handler functions/HAL handler functions are completed. At the same time, it must be
 * initialized at the beginning of calling other functional module interfaces. You need to fill in the developer
 * information correctly to ensure the initialization is successful. For additional instructions, please refer to the
 * tutorial“PSDK Initialization”.
 * @note This function does not return until the correct aircraft type and PSDK adapter type is obtained. The logic ensures
 * that aircraft and PSDK adapter have been started up normally before PSDK functional module and user's program run.
 * General execution time of this function is 2~4 seconds.
 * @param userInfo: pointer to the PSDK application information.
 * @return Execution result.

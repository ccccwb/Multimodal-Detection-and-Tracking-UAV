 * range of yaw value in rotation value argument is [-1800, 1800]. Gimbal can rotate to any angle of yaw axis by the
 * range. Symbol of yaw value does not determine the rotation direction of the gimbal.
 * @note Attitude that gimbal can reach is also determined by angle limitation and angle limitation buffer of the gimbal.
 * When the gimbal is upward, angle limitation differs from limitation users set. For angle limitation and angle limitation
 * buffer, please refer to DJI documentation for details. If gimbal attitude is within range limitation buffer and
 * control gimbal move towards limit direction still, or gimbal attitude is outside the angle limitation buffer but
 * control gimbal to the range limitation buffer, the gimbal will return an error. For the former case, the gimbal will not
 * move. In the latter case, the gimbal will try to move towards the direction of angle limit but it will stop at
 * somewhere in angle limitation buffer.
 * @note Rotation speed and rotation duration are also limited by the maximum speed of gimbal and maximum acceleration. The
 * maximum acceleration is determined by the smooth factor of the gimbal controller set by APP. The maximum speed is determined
 * by default maximum speed and maximum speed percentage set by APP, and the default maximum speed of XPort is
 * 90degree/s. For the detailed relationship, please refer to SetControllerSmoothFactor() and
 * SetControllerMaxSpeedPercentage() callback function prototype in dji_gimbal.h file.
 * @note Only pitch and yaw axis of XPort is controllable.
 * @note XPort do not response rotation command in process of control parameters auto-tuning, coaxiality detection,
 * balance detection and resetting. And these operations will interrupt rotation of XPort.

 * within 500ms after speed control, XPort will stop rotation.

 * @brief Set bandwidth proportion for the data stream, video stream and download stream of high-speed channel.
 * @details Self-defined bandwidth distribution mechanism allows that user can control bandwidth limitation
 * freely. System multiplies total bandwidth limitation of the high-speed channel by a proportion of the corresponding stream to
 * get realtime bandwidth limitation of the specified stream. Realtime bandwidth limitation of data and video stream can be
 * gotten by PsdkDataTransmission_GetDataStreamState() and PsdkPayloadCamera_GetVideoStreamState() interfaces. Total
 * bandwidth of the high-speed channel is determined by the environment in which the system located and loading of system. If
 * user does not set bandwidth proportion for each stream, the default proportion is 33% (data stream), 33% (video
 * stream) and 34% (download stream).
 * @note The bandwidth proportion will be effective after a while, the max value is 1s. If you want use this interface, should calling
 * PsdkPlatform_RegHalNetworkHandler interface firstly, otherwise this interface will not work.
 * @param bandwidthProportion: bandwidth proportion of each stream of high-speed channel. The Sum of bandwidth proportion
 * must equal 100.
